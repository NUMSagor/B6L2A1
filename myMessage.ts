Assalamualaikum  Brother,

Have a good time. I am a self learner. I started learning coding about one year ago from youtube and other free resource as well as documentation. By facing regular family,business and other personal hussel I tried to learn.

Because of proper guidance and proper learning path I could not able to learn effectively. After being amitted here in Programming Hero I clearly realized that I have a lots of lacking in basic/foundation of programming. I think I am in the worst situation. Beacause I failed to building logic. Sometime I cannot make basic syntax correctly.Some things I nderstand easily, and some other things hardly understand after passing lots of time.
Even  I face  such situation that the thing I learn few hours ago I making mistak now.

I have to make my basic or foundation of coding more strong. How can I do that? Please help.

Thanking You-

N U M Sagor
